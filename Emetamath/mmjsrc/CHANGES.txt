Changes vs. original mmj lib by Mel'O'Cat:
- changed Systemizer and Tokenizer SourceId to Object, in order to accomodate with IFile
- added SourcePosition class to store source position of Metamath elements (Chapters, Sections, )
- added LoadProgress class to give feedback about the loading progress
- added ReaderProvider class to enable opening IFile's instead of File's when using include
- added clear methods to BookManager and SeqAssigner to enable (partial) rebuild
- added access to the stepSelectionStore object from the ProofWorksheet
- added a list of incomplete proofs to LogicalSystem
- added an interface for "StepProof" to StepProofStmt, to expose only basic properties (not linked with a Worksheet)
- added the method "apply" to formula, for applying a set of substitutions (similar to a method in VerifyProof, but without need of the class context)
