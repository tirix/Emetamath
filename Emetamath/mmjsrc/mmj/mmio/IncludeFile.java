/**
 * Nitty-gritty IncludeFile work switching Tokenizers and
 * keeping a list, checking it twice.
 * <p>
 * Strategy overview:
 * The top level MetaMath source file Tokenizer is never closed
 * as include files are processed, but a nested include file
 * statement will close the outer include file, process the
 * inner and then "restart" the outer include file where it
 * left off. This is slightly crude but is a fair compromise
 * since nested include files are unlikely AND there is
 * probably an extra file handle hanging around, so we don't
 * need to close the top level MetaMath source file.
